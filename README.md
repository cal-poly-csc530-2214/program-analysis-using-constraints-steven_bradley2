#Program Analysis as Constraint Solving

I read through this paper a few times in an attempt to understand the subject matter. At this point, I am still struggling to understand what exactly this paper is discussing. So for the time that I alotted to this assignment, most of it was spent trying to understand the motivation and contributions of this paper. To do so, I took a look at program verification and constraint solving. In addition to this, I spent some time installing z3 and trying to get working examples.


### Program verification resources:

### Constraint solving:

After reading through the resources above, I feel that I somewhat have a better understanding of why this paper is significant. However, I will admit, I am still a bit lost. I wish I had a better understanding as implementing things is more fun than repeatedly reading papers.
